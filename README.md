WELKOME TO THE CITM'S ZORK:
Place: The game will take place in the CITM Buildings with three floors with different

rooms in each one.

History: The protagonist is a boy called Sam and he is 18 years old. He is studying

videogames and he has to deliver a very important work that has been a lot of hours

working in it, but one boy of his class steals him, this boy is Pep, is a bad student and

he is repeating the curse. Sam is not a strong boy, he is short and a little bit shy, but he

is so clever and this will help him. He has to think what to do to get his work back to

deliver it. To achieve this he will have to explore all the rooms and floors of the

building finding clues and puzzles to find out the way to take the work from Pep.
