WELKOME TO THE CITM'S ZORK:  
Place: The game will take place in the CITM Buildings with three floors with different
rooms in each one.  
Now is a game with real time behaviour and there's a Npc that moves randomly for the rooms every X time.
To win the game you will have to find your homework, to achieve this you will have to talk with other Npc that will help you find them.
Good Luck.  

HOW TO PLAY:     
To move through the rooms use the command Go plus the direction you want(north, south, east, west).  
You can also move by just writting the direction, for example north or 'n'.  
You can look all the posible exits typing Look plus the direction you want. You can also look the room where you are  
typing Look    
You can  open/close doors by writting open or close plus the direction.  
If you need any help with the commands type help or 'h'.   
And finally if you want to exit the game press 'q' or write quit.    
Now there are Npc, to see its description write Description or description plus the Npc name.    
To talk with this Npc write talk or Talk plus the Npc name.    
To buy items you have to write buy or Buy plus Npc name.    
HOW TO RUN IT:         
Open the .exe      
     
If you want to download the code, press download ZIP, when you have it first of all,    
probably the first load will fail, try just to reload the solution, if this doesn't work      
open the folder CITM Zork and execute the CITMZork.vcxproj a window will apear if you have VisualStudio 2015,      
in this window press Cancel, then press F5 to compile it and then close it.      
Save the new sdl in the folder CITM-Zork-master and replace the older one.Now you can open the project with the snl.      
Sorry to bother you.
